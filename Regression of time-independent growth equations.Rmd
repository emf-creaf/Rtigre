The time-independent growth equations described in this package are intrinsically nonlinear in the $k$ parameter. Regressing growth $y_{2}-y_{1}$ against a linear function of a set of parameters through the $k$ parameter may quickly become problematic. Non-linear regressions usually require a good set of initial parameters for the algorithm to converge to a global minimum, lest we end up in a local minimum or without convergence at all. Therefore, guaranteeing convergence implies finding a good set of starting values to feed the regression function.
